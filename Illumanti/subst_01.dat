Simple api for loading in mod lua files.
This works around a bug in the x4 ui.xml style lua loading which fails
to initialize the globals table.

Usage is kept simple:
    When the ui reloads or a game is loaded, a ui event is raised.
    User MD code will set up a cue to trigger on this event and signal to
    lua which file to load.
    Lua will then "require" the file, effectively loading it into the game.

This lua file is itself included by modding an official ui.xml. Lua added
in this way is imported correctly into X4, though there are limited
official ui.xml files which can be modified in this way.
    

Example from MD:

    <cue name="Load_Lua_Files" instantiate="true">
    <conditions>
        <event_ui_triggered screen="'Lua_Loader'" control="'Ready'" />
    </conditions>
    <actions>
        <raise_lua_event name="'Lua_Loader.Load'" param="'extensions.named_pipes_api.Named_Pipes'"/>
    </actions>
    </cue>
  
Here, the cue name can be anything, and the param is the specific
path to the lua file to load, without extension.
The file extension may be ".lua" or ".txt", where the latter may be
needed to distribute lua files through steam workshop.
The lua file needs to be loose, not packed in a cat/dat.
